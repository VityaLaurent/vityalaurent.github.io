           Cause he studyed a lot, like loads of super cool stuff (he is smart, I think)

        <p>Spent the last few years deep in books, labs, and logistics hubs — from Paris to Moscow.<br>
            Not just collecting degrees, but actually getting into the grit of how things work. <br>
            I turned overcomplicated chaos into “yeah, that actually makes sense now.<br> <strong></strong>

            Okay, exp. is not his strongest point, but he did work in france and russia in logistic, it s a good beginning right ?

            He can speak a few languages fluently, english and french, and he is pretty good in russian and german <br>
            For real, actually B2 good (he'll soon be C1 in German, sicher)

              <h3> The infamous Orange Dude: </h3>
                “Look, this guy Laurent — very smart, people are talking about him. <br>
                Studied in Paris, Moscow, Oxford — the best places, believe me. He understands logistics, supply chains, concrete — you name it.<br>
                I’ve seen a lot of people, a lot of résumés — his is one of the best. Tremendous potential. Absolutely world-class.” <br>

                    I bet you’ve got some epic adventures ahead — just don’t forget to take a break and enjoy the simple stuff, like a good sandwich or a cool magic spell. <br>
